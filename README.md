# DEFINE-1.1
This repository contains the R code for the main simulation results in: Dafermos Y. and Nikolaidi, M., ‘How can green differentiated capital requirements affect climate risks? A dynamic macrofinancial analysis’, Journal of Financial Stability.

To run this code: (1) install R (https://cran.r-project.org/) and R Studio (https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/); (2) download the R file ‘R DEFINE 1.1 CODE’; (3) download the file ‘_DEFINE_Carbontaxes’ and put it in the same folder as the file ‘R DEFINE 1.1 CODE’; (4) run the code by clicking on the ‘Source’ button in R.

The code generates the Figures 1, 2, 3, B.1, D.1, D.2 and D.3 as well as the Tables 1 and 3 of the paper. Note that you will need to install the R package ‘Cairo’ before running the code. To do so use the command: install.packages("Cairo").
